- Project purpose: 
The idea of our project is to create a Trivia Quiz game with a colorful UI done in WPF for a better user experience. You can play by yourself or you can challenge your friends by creating your own personal quiz in the Quizzical Model. For the player mode you can choose multiple categories. Also there are three levels of difficulty. If you feel stuck you can benefit from two types of hints. Your score also will be updated based on your correct answers. For the Quizzard mode you can choose to create three types of different questions, you can add as many as you want and then give them to your friends to play.
